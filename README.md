# ModularBase
This repository holds reference software necessary to complete a build of the Modular Motorized Base.  For more information, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWthD6qFxf1QTJ-ut3aWMmxZf2CwbiQ4Cnnj9_wa7wU

# Getting Started
You will need to create a folder on your computer called ModularBase.  
Download the ModularBase.ino file, and store it in the folder you just created.
If you haven't already done so, download and install the Arduino IDE from http://www.arduino.org/software

Until we have better instructions on the upload process, you can refer to this tutorial:
